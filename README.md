# Simple-medical-center-project-in-Bash
Project for my Operating Systems Laboratory course which includes a command-line-based Medical Center Management System implemented using Bash scripting. It provides a simple yet functional platform for both patients and doctors to manage medical records, prescriptions, appointments, and basic health-related interactions.
